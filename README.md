## Environment Setup

The competition environment uses Python 3.12.7 and includes a comprehensive set of dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). The contestants were not allowed to install other external libraries, so these were the only packages they could use. Below are instructions for setting up the environment using different package managers.

### Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Create and activate a new conda environment
conda create -n ioai-2025 python=3.12.7
conda activate ioai-2025

# Update pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
```

### Using venv

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python3.12 -m venv ioai-2025
source ioai-2025/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv ioai-2025
.\ioai-2025\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (all platforms)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
```

### Using pyenv

```bash
# Install Python 3.12.7
pyenv install 3.12.7
pyenv local 3.12.7

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: The `--no-deps` flag is required to ensure exact package versions match the competition environment.
